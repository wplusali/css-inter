# üèóÔ∏è Implement CSS Variables in Style Sheet

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to manage CSS values that are used in multiple CSS rules in a more efficient manner.

## Instructions

* Create two CSS Variables:
  * One for any repeated color value
  * One for any repeated border radius value

### üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

## What does the term DRY mean in web development? ##

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

In web development, the term "DRY" stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." This is a fundamental principle aimed at reducing the repetition of software patterns, replacing duplicate code with abstractions, and using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

The DRY principle is key for several reasons:

1. **Maintainability**: When the same piece of code is repeated in multiple places, any change requires updating all these instances. This is both time-consuming and error-prone. Following the DRY principle means that you only need to make changes in one place, simplifying maintenance.

2. **Readability and Clarity**: Code that avoids unnecessary repetition is typically more readable and easier to understand. This is especially important in team environments, where multiple people will be reading and working with the same codebase.

3. **Efficiency in Development**: DRY code can reduce the development time, as it prevents developers from writing the same code multiple times. This also translates to fewer bugs and easier debugging, as there's less code to manage and test.

4. **Scalability**: As a project grows, DRY practices can make it easier to expand and add new features without having to wade through repetitive, convoluted code.

In the context of CSS, as per your previous question, using variables for common values like colors or margins is a good example of applying the DRY principle. By defining a value once and referencing it wherever needed, you keep your code DRY, making it easier to manage and update.
